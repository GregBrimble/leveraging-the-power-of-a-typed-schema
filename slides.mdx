## Leveraging the Power of a Typed Schema:<br />Designing User Interfaces with GraphQL

> Greg Brimble

<Notes>
Hi. My name is Greg Brimble, and I'm going to be giving this talk entitled "Leveraging the Power of a Typed Schema: Designing User Interfaces with GraphQL". It's a bit of a mouthful, but we'll break it down as we go.

I'd first like to thank Kristian arranging this conference and for inviting me to present. I hope you all find this talk interesting.

If you have any questions or anything, I'll be in the Live Chat as this airs, so feel free to drop a message.

Otherwise, if you're watching this after-the-fact, my contact info is on the final slide, so feel free to just get in touch.

# Automatically Consistent User Interfaces

<Appear>

# Reduces Development Time

</Appear>

<Notes>
Imagine you've got two engineering teams, front-end and back-end. Obviously a lot of planning and collaboration is required to for these teams to work together, and often, they're a bit out-of-sync: the back-end team might have built features that aren't yet available in the production app, or the front-end team are waiting on one last little thing before they can ship their feature.

So, the goal today is to create automatically consistent UIs. We don't want to have to do front-end development everytime we make a back-end change. We want to see this handled automatically.

It saves us doing work twice. This is all in aid of reducing development time.

# Inbuilt GraphQL Types

```
scalar Int

scalar Float

scalar String

scalar Boolean

scalar ID
```

---

# Custom Scalars

`npm install --save graphql-scalars`

```
scalar DateTime

scalar EmailAddress

scalar PhoneNumber

scalar URL

# etc.
```

# Rendering GraphQL Types

---

# Rendering GraphQL Types

1. *Developer:* Register React components to specific GraphQL types

## Preparation

1. *Root:* Execute inspection query

1. *Root:* Parse result and store GraphQL type information in React context

---

# Rendering GraphQL Types

## Rendering

1. *Root:* Execute data query

1. *Root:* For each field in result, pass returned data and field information to *Renderer*

1. *Renderer:* Reconcile the field with its GraphQL type using *Root* React context

1. *Renderer:* Lookup registered components in *Root* React context
    1. If type is registered, render with data and field information
    1. If type isn't registered and it is an object, expand its fields and repeat from step two
    1. Otherwise, if its a scalar type that isn't registered, render with default component or throw error

# Rendering GraphQL Inputs

# Rendering GraphQL Inputs

1. *Developer:* Registerer React components to specific GraphQL types **and inputs**

## Preparation

1. ***Root*: `const [variables, setVariables] = useState()`**

1. *Root:* Execute introspection query

1. *Root:* Parse result and store GraphQL type **and input** information in React context

# Rendering GraphQL Inputs

## Rendering

1. *Root:* Execute data query

1. *Root:* For each field in result, pass returned data and field information to *Renderer*

1. *Renderer:* Reconcile the field with its GraphQL type using *Root* React context

1. ***Renderer:* If the GraphQL type has input arguments:**
    1. **Lookup registered components in *Root* React context**
    1. **Render with data, field information and make `onChange` to call `setVariables`**

    1. If type isn't registered and it is an object, expand its fields and repeat from step two

# Use Cases

- Input Forms (e.g. Checkout)

- Data-rich Pages (e.g. Contacts)

- Tables (filtering, sorting, etc.)

- Admin Dashboards

    - Mutations
